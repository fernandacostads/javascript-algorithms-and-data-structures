/*
  When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.

  if (num > 10) {
    return "Bigger than 10";
  } else {
    return "10 or Less";
  }
  Combine the if statements into a single if/else statement.

  You should only have one if statement in the editor

  You should use an else statement

  testElse(4) should return the string 5 or Smaller

  testElse(5) should return the string 5 or Smaller

  testElse(6) should return the string Bigger than 5

  testElse(10) should return the string Bigger than 5

  You should not change the code above or below the specified comments.
